**What is a component?**

An app is made up of components and a component is a "building block". Components can for example be elements in an app that is used multiple times.

**What is data binding?**

Data binding is the binding of a component to an app where data flows between them. There are multiple versions of data binding, like one where data flows from the component to the browser, one where data flows from the browser to the component and one where data flows both ways. A typical data binding is the use of interpolation to send HTML content from a function and make a component in the browser.

**What does array.map() do?**

The array.map()-method takes an array and makes a new array. It uses a callback function to go through every index of the old array and uses the commands in the callback to make a value to push into the new array.

**What are props?**

"Props" is a shorthand term for "properties" and are basically what components are made up of. A function for a component would for example take in props as arguments to use as content in the component.

**What does export default do?**

"Export default" tells what assets a module will expose to other modules that imports it.
